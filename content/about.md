I am an explorer of the unseen—of symbols, dreams, and the deep structures that shape our reality. My journey has led me through the worlds of physics, mathematics, Jungian psychology, alchemy, and mysticism, always in search of the patterns that connect.

By day, I work as a Site Reliability Engineer (formerly at Google), navigating the intricate logic of complex systems. But my true passion lies in decoding the hidden architecture of the psyche—in dreams, in film, in ancient esoteric traditions.

I was once on the path to a PhD in physics before I walked away, drawn instead to the philosophical and symbolic mysteries beneath equations and abstractions. That same drive led me to Freemasonry, alchemy, and the psychological landscapes mapped by Jung.

This blog is my personal Great Work—a collection of my dreams, active imaginations, and Jungian film analyses, exploring the individuation process, the Shadow, and the eternal dance of the conscious and unconscious mind. I write to integrate, to uncover, and to share the mysteries that unfold within and without.

If you seek the hidden meanings beneath the surface of things—whether in dreams, cinema, or ancient traditions—you are in the right place. Welcome.
