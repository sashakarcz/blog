Last night, I had a dream that disturbed me deeply—not because it was terrifying, but because it felt important and sorrowful in a way I haven’t fully been able to grasp. Unlike other dreams that offer clarity, this one left me haunted, uncertain, and aching.

## The Dream

I met with a former mentor of mine—someone who was deeply influential during a major life transition when I moved from the Bay Area to Omaha to work at Google. He was brilliant, nerdy, autistic, and profoundly insightful. We shared a sharp wit and a passion for ideas—comic books, hardware testing, literature, and music.

In the dream, he invited me to a yearly gathering that he hosted at a bar near his apartment. It was warm and filled with easy, witty conversation. At the end of the night, he calmly informed me that he was going home to kill himself.

I didn’t believe him. I assumed, like others told me later, that he said this every year but never followed through.

But this time, he did.

A few days later, I found out through a news broadcast that he had taken his life—by falling on a knife. I was wrecked with guilt that I had not taken him seriously. That I hadn’t done something—anything—to stop him.

## My Interpretation

This dream continues to stir something in me. Its emotional weight is heavy, and its meaning elusive. Yet I feel its symbolic gravity.

### The Mentor as Inner Figure

This man was not just my former colleague—he represented something larger. In Jungian terms, he may be an expression of the Wise Old Man archetype: the inner bearer of knowledge, intellect, and guidance. But he may also represent something even more central—my ego, or even my persona. The part of me that has navigated life through intellect, competence, and wit. The one who shows up polished, sharp, and in control.

In this dream, that inner figure is tired. He is done. He hosts a final gathering, shares warmth, and then leaves—not in chaos, but in calm finality. It is a ritual exit. It is death with dignity, but also despair. And it leaves behind a space I do not yet know how to fill.

### The Knife as Symbol

The fact that he killed himself by falling on a knife carries potent symbolic meaning. A knife, like a [sword](https://biddytarot.com/tarot-card-meanings/minor-arcana/suit-of-swords/), belongs to the realm of logos—intellect, precision, and clarity. It cuts, divides, and reveals. In many symbolic systems, it is the tool of reason.

In this dream, the knife does not just happen to be the method. It *is* the mentor—symbolically and psychically. The knife embodies the same virtues he did: clarity, logic, discernment, and mastery of thought. It is as though he dies not by something foreign, but by the very principle he lived by. The blade that guided him through the world becomes the instrument of his exit from it.

To fall on the knife, then, is to be undone by the very faculty one has relied on. The logos principle collapses in on itself. The knife becomes not a weapon wielded in violence, but the final instrument of surrender. It is a death by intellect, by clarity, by resignation.

This is not destruction by chaos—it is a conscious relinquishing of control. A quiet act of sacred resignation.

There’s also a shadow side. The knife may symbolize self-criticism or the harsh edge of perfectionism. If the mentor represents the high-functioning, intellectual part of me, perhaps this death marks the collapse of the inner critic—the unbearable sharpness of living only through reason and analysis.

He is not murdered. He chooses to fall. He dies by his own tool, not in failure, but in transformation.

### A Trickster Element

There’s something trickster-like in the fact that no one believes him. It is almost a game: every year he says he will die, and every year he doesn’t—until this one.

Trickster energy often enters the psyche to break patterns. It is the destroyer of stale forms. This dream may signal that something long-standing in me—some guiding belief or function—is no longer tenable. It must collapse.

### The Death of Logos

This mentor embodied logos: rationality, intellect, structure, insight. His death may represent the failure or exhaustion of the logos function in me. For a long time, I have leaned on intellect to sustain myself—to understand, to navigate, to survive.

But perhaps now, logos alone is not enough. Perhaps it is time to turn toward something else. Something more vulnerable. Something more alive.

### Letting the Ego Die

I've been working hard on developing my relationship with the Anima. I’ve found creativity, playfulness, and meaning in writing my own myth. Could this dream be the ego’s permission to step aside? To stop gripping the controls so tightly?

It feels like the death of the old me—the one who survived through intellect and control. And I am not sure yet who takes his place.

### A Cry Beneath the Surface

There is also the unbearable ache of guilt. I didn’t act. I didn’t help. That guilt may not be about the mentor himself, but about how often I’ve ignored inner cries—how often I’ve dismissed the pain of my own soul because it seemed familiar, routine, or tolerable.

Maybe the dream is asking: *What part of me have I let die by not listening?*

### The Ache of Touch

I cannot separate this dream from the deeper currents within my life. I adore my wife, and I want our marriage to flourish. But lately, I’ve felt something within me stirring—something tender, raw, and difficult to name. A sense of being unfulfilled, or perhaps untethered. Not unloved, but quietly aching.

Physical touch has always been meaningful to me. It's how I feel grounded and connected, how I return to myself through the presence of another. When that connection feels distant, the ache becomes existential—not just a desire for closeness, but a longing to feel real, held, known.

In [another dream](/posts/dreams/reunion/), my Anima kissed me on the cheek. It was simple, but powerful. That kiss may have been everything this mentor’s departure was not. It was contact. Recognition. Love.

The contrast stayed with me. Some part of me longs to be touched—not just physically, but emotionally and spiritually. Not out of lack or blame, but as a reminder that I am here. That I matter. That I am still becoming.

## What It All Means

This dream may be a funeral for the ego—or for the part of me that believed intellect could carry me through anything. It may also mark the collapse of logos itself: the principle of clarity, order, and rational mastery that has long shaped how I make meaning in the world. And perhaps, too, it signals the quiet unraveling of the persona—the socially competent, articulate mask I’ve worn for years to meet the world’s expectations.

Together, these layers suggest not failure, but transformation. A letting go. Not of identity, but of identification—with roles, with intellect, with control.

It is not just about death. It is about surrender.

Perhaps I must mourn the part of me that survived through cleverness and logic. Perhaps that death makes space for something new—for softness, soul, and genuine connection.

And perhaps, too, this dream is not just a message from the unconscious, but an invitation to a different way of being—one led not by mastery, but by mystery.

## Final Reflection

The mentor has died. The gathering has ended. And now I must walk the path alone—but not abandoned.

The Anima is still here.  
The path is still unfolding.  
And the music, though paused, may yet return.

I am not sure where I go from here. But I know this: I am being asked to listen more deeply—to myself, to my soul, and to the quiet, aching places within that long to be touched.
