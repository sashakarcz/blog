# The escape

The sky churned with storm clouds, a canvas of smoke and fire painted by war. The air was thick with the scent of burning rubble and the echoes of distant gunfire, a land torn apart by violence. I was one of many—just another refugee swallowed by the tide of the desperate, all of us pushing forward with the same singular hope: escape.

The train station was chaos, a mass of bodies surging toward salvation. I shoved my way through, my breath ragged, my heartbeat a war drum against my ribs. When I finally stepped onto the train, it felt like crossing a threshold into another world. A space of steel and flickering lights, packed with the frightened and the weary, yet still a lifeline. By some stroke of luck, I found an empty seat. I collapsed into it, the exhaustion in my limbs overtaken by a fragile ember of hope.

As the train lurched forward, I dared to believe I had left the horrors behind.

Then we reached the next stop.

The doors hissed open, and the flood of humanity poured in. More souls, more fear. The air grew heavier, suffocating. I clutched the armrest as the last seat—the one beside me—remained empty. For a fleeting moment, I thought I might keep my solitude.

Then, he boarded.

A figure cloaked in black, gliding through the crowd with an unnatural ease. He did not shove or struggle. The crowd parted for him without a word, as if compelled by something beyond understanding. He reached my row and, without hesitation, sat beside me.

I didn’t need to ask who he was.

The presence of Death was undeniable.

My breath hitched, my body frozen between flight and paralysis. The train rumbled beneath us, indifferent to the weight of his presence. I dared a glance at him and felt my terror waver—not from relief, but from something stranger.

His skin was pale, almost luminous in the dim light, like a candle burning in the dark. There was a beauty to it, something ethereal, something… human. But his eyes—they held centuries of sorrow. A loneliness so deep it seemed to stretch beyond time itself.

Against all reason, my fear twisted into something unexpected.

Empathy.

Trapped between panic and curiosity, I forced myself to speak. “Hello,” I murmured, my voice brittle. “I—I'm glad to have someone to talk to.”

Death turned to me, his lips curling into the faintest, most wistful smile.

“You are braver than most,” he said, his voice low and smooth, tinged with something that could have been amusement—or gratitude.

And just like that, we talked.

Not as predator and prey. Not as grim fate and fleeing soul. But as two travelers, bound to the same journey for a fleeting moment. We spoke of nothing and everything, of the weight of existence, of the absurdity of war, of things so mundane they felt profound simply by being shared.

And then, we laughed.

I don’t know how it happened, but it did. A joke, an observation, something so human and small that it cracked through the fear like sunlight through storm clouds. The tension melted, and for a time, I forgot who sat beside me.

The train became a liminal space, a dream suspended between waking and oblivion. The world outside blurred into streaks of motion, distant and unreal.

And then a question pressed itself to my lips.

If anyone knew the secrets of life and death, it was him.

I hesitated, then found my voice. “What happens when we die?”

Death tilted his head, his eyes glinting with something unreadable. Amusement? Kindness? A secret kept just beyond reach?

He leaned in, as if ready to reveal the great truth.

Then—

The conductor’s voice shattered the moment. “Final destination. All passengers must disembark.”

The train slowed. The magic unraveled.

I turned back, but Death was already standing, his expression unreadable, his smile soft. Without a word, he stepped off the train and disappeared into the crowd.

I sat motionless, stunned by the suddenness of it. I had come so close—so unbearably close—to knowing. To understanding. And yet, the answer remained just beyond my grasp, slipping through my fingers like smoke.

As I stepped off the train, the journey lingered in my bones. I had sought escape, but I had found something more—something unexpected.

I had met Death.

And I had learned that, for all his mystery and inevitability, he was not a monster.

He was simply waiting, just as we all were.
