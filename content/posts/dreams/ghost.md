# The Ghost Lady

_I experienced this dream when I was a teenager, maybe 13-16 age._

I was traveling with my parents, leaving behind the familiar streets of my childhood hometown for the towering skyline of the state capital. It was a rare trip—just the three of us, my siblings absent—making it feel oddly special, like a fleeting moment of undivided attention.

But what truly thrilled me wasn’t the city itself. I had convinced my parents to drop me off at a friend’s house—a friend who had recently moved here, who had just bought her own home. The idea of visiting her, of seeing the life she had built, filled me with eager anticipation. To my surprise, my parents agreed.

They pulled up in front of her house, a modest but welcoming place nestled in a quiet neighborhood. As they drove away, I wandered into the backyard, my footsteps light with excitement. The golden glow of early evening stretched long shadows across the grass, the air thick with the lingering warmth of summer. A familiar, childlike sense of adventure stirred in me.

The yard was bordered by a row of thick bushes, separating it from the street. On impulse, I began leaping over them, reveling in the unrestrained joy of movement, the way my body soared weightlessly before landing. The world felt simple in those brief seconds—untouched, free.

Then I looked down.

A cold shock shot through me, freezing me mid-step. Beneath my feet, just beyond the bushes, lay graves. Dozens of them.

The realization hit like a stone dropped into deep water, rippling outward until it touched every part of me. I had been leaping over graves. Laughing. Playing. Completely oblivious to the weight of the dead beneath me.

The air changed. The warmth of the evening thickened into something oppressive, pressing against my skin like unseen hands. The once-inviting yard felt wrong, as if I had crossed into a place where I didn’t belong.

I backed away, heart hammering, exhilaration draining into something colder, heavier. Then, without thinking, I turned and ran into the house to ask my friend about the graves.

Inside, the air was even heavier. It coiled around me, dense and unmoving, as if the house itself was holding its breath. I had barely set foot in the doorway before I saw her.

My friend.

Even in exhaustion, she was beautiful. Her black hair was pulled into a haphazard ponytail, her sweater frayed and full of holes. She moved with quiet urgency, weaving through the house, tending to something just beyond my line of sight.

And then I saw them.

The rooms were filled with the sick and suffering. Not living people, but ghosts. Pale, bed-bound spirits lay in makeshift hospital beds, their forms flickering like candle flames in a draft. They clung to the edges of existence, as if trapped between this world and whatever lay beyond.

My friend looked up, and for the first time since arriving, our eyes met.

Relief softened her face. “I’m so glad you’re here,” she breathed, the weight of her burden momentarily lifting.

The ghosts. The graves. The thick silence pressing in from all sides.

I couldn’t take it.

The ghosts, the graves—it was all too much. Panic surged within me, and I bolted from the house to the front yard. Pacing back and forth, I anxiously hoped for my parents to return and take me away from this house and everything inside of it. This was not what I had expected, and I felt overwhelmed by the strangeness of it all.

Yet, as I waited, a deeper longing stirred in my heart. Despite the eerie surroundings, the thought of leaving my friend alone to handle this was unbearable. The connection I felt with her was stronger than my fear.

I took a deep breath, steeling myself, and made the decision to return. Walking back into the house, I was greeted by my friend’s bright smile. She was waiting for me, and when she saw me, she smiled—not just a smile of gratitude, but of understanding. She knew that I had chosen to stay and help her, and that she no longer had to bear this burden alone.

In that moment, surrounded by ghosts and graves, I felt a profound sense of purpose. Together, we faced the haunting presence, finding strength in our shared commitment. The eerie house transformed into a place of healing and connection, as I embraced my role in helping my friend tend to the restless spirits.
