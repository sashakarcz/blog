description: "This dream is a story of transformation through suffering, a journey through the archetypal death and rebirth process. The dream ego has undergone the classic night sea journey, but instead of returning as a victorious hero, he returns as something else entirely—neither good nor evil, neither saint nor damned."

# The Crusader 

I was a Crusader in the Holy Land, my blade wet with the blood of heathens. My squad and I had completed our mission, and we rode victorious toward the towering walls of our fortress. The sun blazed overhead, casting long shadows over the dust-choked road, our armor clinking with the sound of triumph.

As we crossed the threshold, the Grandmaster himself awaited us in the courtyard. His presence commanded reverence; his gaze, sharp as steel, gleamed with approval. "You have done well," he proclaimed, his voice ringing through the stone halls. "But your greatest task still lies ahead. You are to march into the very mouth of Hell itself and do God's work. You will purge the wicked. You will vanquish the enemy."

The command sent a surge of holy fervor through my veins. My brothers-in-arms roared their approval. We would be God's sword and flame. That night, we sharpened our weapons, knelt in solemn prayer, and dreamt of a world purified.

At dawn, we set out, the sun rising behind us, casting our figures as long silhouettes upon the holy land. Days passed in silent devotion. We marched, we fasted, we prayed, unshaken in our faith. And then, we reached The Cave.

A gaping wound in the earth. The threshold of Hell.

We descended.

The light from the entrance faded behind us, and the air thickened, laced with sulfur and decay. Our torches flickered feebly, their flames shuddering in the oppressive darkness. The walls dripped with moisture, or perhaps something else, something thicker. Heat pressed in on us, seeping through our armor, burning our flesh. But we did not waver.

We were God’s chosen. We had nothing to fear.

A faint, reddish glow appeared in the distance, pulsing like the heartbeat of some vast, unseen beast. We pressed on.

A voice, ancient and slow, slithered through the cavern. "Turn back."

I stepped forward, raising my sword. "Repent, devils, or be vanquished!"

Laughter erupted from the darkness.

Then they came.

From every fissure, every crack, they poured forth—twisted things, their bodies writhing, shifting between shapes, their eyes glowing like embers. Clawed hands, gnashing teeth, shrieking mouths. They crashed upon us like a tide, and we met them with righteous steel.

Faith held our swords steady, and for a time, we fought.

For a time, we believed.

But one by one, my brothers fell, their cries swallowed by the roar of demons. Blood, thick and black, slicked the stones beneath us. My lungs burned from the sulfur, my vision blurred from heat and exhaustion. Still, I fought, swinging wildly, blindly, until I alone remained, surrounded by their endless numbers.

A shadow loomed before me, vast and terrible.

The demon lord.

His presence crushed me, an abyss of malice and knowing. His eyes, black pits burning with fire, stared through me, peeling away my soul layer by layer.

"Death is too kind for this one," he said, his voice as deep as the earth. "Let him imitate his Christ."

A crude cross was built. Hands dragged me forward. Spikes were driven through my wrists, my feet. They raised me up—a mockery of my Savior’s sacrifice.

But pain was not their goal.

They did not want my death.

They wanted my surrender.

For days, they let me linger. My lips cracked, my body wasted, the weight of my own flesh pulling against the nails. They came to me, whispered to me, laughed at me.

"Renounce Him," they said. "Your God has abandoned you."

"You suffer because He allows it. Because He wills it."

"Join us, and you will suffer no more."

Through the delirium, I clung to my faith. My breath came in ragged gasps, my thoughts frayed at the edges.

Then, He came.

The demon lord stepped forward, staring up at me with something like amusement.

"You believe you are doing God's will," he said. "But is your God not all-powerful? If He wanted evil gone, would He not erase it? Why does He command you to fight His battles? Unless…" He smiled, slow and knowing. "Unless evil is His will."

The words slithered into my mind. I could not block them out.

"Your suffering is His design."

"We are the ones who accept our true nature."

"It is you who live in delusion."

"Tear yourself free and be reborn."

I felt my breath hitch.

And then, I moved.

I ripped my hands from the nails.

Flesh tore. Bone cracked.

And time—stopped.

Before me, in the infinite stillness, a face emerged. Not the face of the demon.

The face of God.

He looked at me.

And He spoke.

"I curse you."

"You shall live for eternity without peace, without comfort, without love."

"You will wander. And you will know despair."

I fell.

The demons gathered around me, their faces filled not with malice but with joy. They embraced me, their touch warm. Loving.

Time unraveled.

Centuries passed.

I lived, and I died. And I lived again.

Over and over.

Each life an illusion. Each death a cruel joke. I watched those I loved wither, sicken, perish. I wept. I raged.

The demons had not lied.

It was God who had damned me.

Then, one day, I found myself here.

In my own time. In my own city.

I stood in a small shop filled with relics of the sacred—crystals, icons, and symbols from all faiths. My family moved about, unaware of the weight in my chest, the centuries of torment pressing against my ribs.

Beside me stood my brother.

And for the first time in my endless existence, I spoke.

I told him.

Everything.

Naturally, he did not believe me. How could he?

But I could prove it.

"Have you noticed that I never touch crosses?" I asked. "They make me sick. They burn my flesh."

He hesitated. Then, cautiously, he handed me a crucifix.

At the mere sight of it, nausea wracked me. My skin sizzled, black smoke curling from my fingers, the scent of burning flesh filling the air. I collapsed to the floor, writhing in agony.

My brother’s face—wide-eyed, horror-stricken—hovered above me.

And for the first time in centuries, I felt something that was neither torment nor pain.

I felt seen.
