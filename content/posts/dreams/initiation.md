# The Initiation

My son tugged at my sleeve, his eyes bright with anticipation. The gym around us hummed with the familiar rhythms of treadmills and clanking weights, its sterile brightness offering no hint of the revelation that awaited me.

"Just a quick look around," I told him, ruffling his hair. "Then we’ll decide."

The tour guide, a young man with a well-practiced smile, led us through the standard circuit—rows of elliptical machines, the scent of chlorine wafting faintly from somewhere beyond. But my gaze drifted to a discreet sign: POOL ACCESS.

A pull. A whisper at the edges of my mind.

"I’ll catch up," I told my son and the guide, already moving toward the sign.

The hallway narrowed. The walls pressed closer. The hum of the gym receded into silence as I descended a spiraling staircase. The air thickened, cool and damp, alive with an unseen presence. The stairs gave way to rusted metal ladders, each rung resonating under my weight, a hollow chime against the vast emptiness below.

Then—solid ground.

The fluorescent glow was gone, swallowed by flickering orange torchlight. I stepped forward, and the world unfolded around me.

A temple. Ancient. Immense.

Towering columns stretched into the shadows, their surfaces etched with hieroglyphs worn smooth by time. The air carried the scent of damp stone and something older, something sacred. At the chamber’s center lay a still, black reflecting pool, its surface unbroken, mirroring the flames above. It was not water, not entirely—it was depth itself, a threshold.

A door into something more.

At the far end of the temple, figures sat enthroned. A queen, regal in crimson, her face hidden behind a gilded mask. Beside her, the king, draped in black, his mask an abyss. They watched in stillness, their presence vast.

Then, a flicker of movement.

A knight stepped into the torchlight, his armor polished to a mirrored gleam. With a single, fluid motion, he drew his sword, the blade an arc of silver fire.

"This place is forbidden," he said, his voice rich with authority, a note of finality beneath it. "The penalty for trespassing is death."

The words did not frighten me. They thrilled me.

I had found something hidden, something untouched by the world above.

The knight raised his sword.

"Wait," the queen commanded, her voice cutting through the chamber like a chime of bronze.

The knight stilled.

"You have crossed the veil," the queen said, inclining her head slightly. "You have seen what was meant to remain unseen. You must choose: death, or initiation."

I knew, with a certainty deeper than thought, that I had already chosen.

"Initiation," I said, the word settling into my bones.

The queen nodded. "Then kneel."

The knight stepped aside, and I lowered myself before the thrones, pulse steady, mind clear.

The queen lifted a ceremonial sword, its edge gleaming like molten gold. She moved it through the air, tracing symbols that burned themselves into the silence, her gestures deliberate, ancient. The air shimmered, charged with meaning.

"You will take the oath," she said.

The words she spoke were not of this time, yet they rose from my lips as though I had always known them. With each phrase, something stirred within me, something vast and nameless, as if I were not simply speaking the words but being reshaped by them.

When the final syllable faded, the queen lowered her sword.

Then, to my astonishment, she stepped forward and embraced me.

The king rose. His presence enveloped me as he, too, embraced me.

The knight followed.

Each touch was a seal, an affirmation, a silent acknowledgment that I was no longer an outsider.

"You may return," the queen said, her voice softer now. "But know this: you are no longer entirely of that world."

I ascended the ladders, my body weightless, my mind alive with wonder. The temple’s torches receded into memory, replaced by the cold sterility of the gym.

Back through the staircases. Back into the fluorescence.

My son was waiting.

"Where did you go, Dad?"

I met his gaze and smiled, feeling, for the first time, the depth of the secret I now carried.

"Just exploring," I said, though the words felt small.

As we walked toward the exit, I glanced back.

The POOL ACCESS sign shimmered, its letters shifting at the edges of my vision, as though the temple itself was retreating from sight.

But I knew better.

I had touched something eternal, something just beneath the surface of the world.

And I knew, with absolute certainty, that this was only the beginning.
