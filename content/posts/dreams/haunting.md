# The Haunting

I was traveling with my wife and sister to visit friends—a couple with a young son, no more than five or six years old. I didn’t know them in real life, but in the dream, they were close friends, people I trusted. Their home was warm, filled with easy laughter and the glow of familiarity. We were to spend the night, a simple visit with people who felt like family.

But as the sun dipped below the horizon, a change settled over the house. The air thickened, pressing in like the weight of unseen eyes. A presence stirred in the quiet spaces—the corners of rooms, the gaps beneath doorways, the places just beyond sight. It wasn’t a feeling of paranoia. It was certainty. Something was here. And it was watching.

The disturbances began subtly. A flickering light. A glass shifting slightly on the table. Then, they escalated. A chair scraped across the floor on its own. The heavy thud of footsteps echoed from empty hallways. Objects rose into the air, trembling before shattering against the walls. The entire house pulsed with a force that did not belong.

I knew what this was.

An evil spirit. Something old, something waiting.

Instinct took over. I reached into my bag and pulled out my Masonic Bible—the same one that rested on the altar of my Lodge, a book of sacred weight and tradition. If anything could banish this presence, it was this. I gripped it tightly, forcing my fear into defiance, and raised it high.

The response was immediate.

An unseen force ripped the Bible from my hands. It flew across the room, striking the wall with unnatural speed before crashing to the floor. The pages tore themselves apart, shredded midair as if by invisible claws. The cover split from the spine, its words scattered in ruin.

Then the spirit came for me.

It struck like a wave of suffocating smoke, wrapping around my body, pressing against my skin with a coldness deeper than winter. The pressure crushed my ribs. My lungs refused to expand. My vision tunneled, narrowing to a single dark point. My heartbeat pounded in my skull, a frantic, dying rhythm.

I screamed.

And I woke up.

The room was dark. My heart still raced. My breath came in ragged gasps.

And then—against all logic, against every instinct—I fell back into the dream.

I found my sister and told her everything. The spirit, the Bible, how it had been destroyed as if it held no power at all.

She listened, then shook her head. Her voice was calm, steady.

“Why did you provoke it?” she asked. “You knew it would fight back.”

Then, without hesitation, she prayed. A voice of strength, of conviction, calling upon something beyond herself.

The spirit struck.

The walls groaned. The air howled. The house convulsed as darkness consumed her.

I turned and ran.

I sought out my friends, the ones who had invited us here. They had to know.

At first, they denied it.

No, nothing was wrong. No, they had never seen anything strange. No, their home was just that—a home.

But their voices faltered, their faces cracked under the weight of something unspoken.

They knew.

And when the silence grew too heavy, they admitted the truth.

Yes, the house was haunted.
Yes, the spirit had been here since they arrived.
No, they could not leave.

And worst of all—the spirit had taken an interest in their son.

I turned to the boy. A precious child sitting on the floor, playing, untouched by the horror that thickened the air. He was laughing, completely unaware. But the spirit was there.

It had always been there.

And it was waiting.

I turned away from my friends. This wasn’t about them. This wasn’t even about me.

It was about the child.

I walked to the darkest part of the house, the place where the air turned leaden, where something unseen coiled in silence.

I stopped.

And then I spoke.

“Come.”

The house held its breath. The walls tightened. The very air seemed to crack, space itself bending inward.

Then it came.

The shadows spilled forward like ink expunging all light in its path. The walls flexed, bending as if they would break.

Every part of me wanted to run. My body screamed for escape, every nerve alight with primal terror.

But I stood my ground.

The spirit rushed me, wrapping around me like a burial shroud.

I let it in.

The cold drove through my skin, deeper than bone, deeper than thought. My breath disappeared. My body fell away.

And then—

Darkness.
