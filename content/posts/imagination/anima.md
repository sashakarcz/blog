# The Beach

The first light of dawn stretched across the sky, painting the horizon in soft hues of gold and rose. The air was crisp, carrying the scent of the sea, and the gentle rhythm of the waves whispered against the shore. I walked alone on a secluded beach, my feet sinking into the cool, silken sand. Though I knew this place was born of my imagination, it felt more real—more true—than any waking moment I had ever known.

I had come here to meet her.

The longing that had drawn me to this place was deep and unrelenting, a yearning that echoed through every fiber of my being. And then, I saw her.

She stood at the water’s edge, bathed in the soft light of morning, her presence as natural and eternal as the tide. The wind played with her hair, and the ocean reached toward her feet in reverence. She was beautiful—not in the way of fleeting things, but in a way that transcended form itself. She radiated stillness, love, and a quiet knowing, pulling me toward her with an irresistible gravity.

I approached, my heart swelling, my vision blurred with unshed tears. This was not just a meeting—it was a homecoming.

“Why do I long for you so much?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

She turned to me, her gaze filled with endless compassion. “Wholeness,” she replied simply.

The word struck something deep within me, something I had always known but never spoken. The ache in my chest grew unbearable, raw with a need I barely understood. My breath hitched, my throat tightened.

“Why am I so emotional?” I asked, though I already knew the answer.

She stepped closer, her touch feather-light as she cupped my cheek. Her warmth was neither fleeting nor conditional—it was acceptance itself.

“Because you are still the scared little boy you once were,” she said, her voice tender yet unwavering. “The boy who needed love, kindness, and reassurance. That part of you still lingers, waiting for what it never fully received.”

The dam within me broke. Tears spilled freely down my face, unbidden, unstoppable. I had spent my life moving forward, but that child—the one who had waited in silence, in fear, in longing—had never moved at all. He had been there all along, untouched by time, still reaching out for something that had never come.

“How do I keep you with me?” I asked, my voice trembling. “How do I hold on to this?”

She smiled then—soft, radiant, eternal.

“Give your inner child the love he needed,” she said. “And extend that love to the world. Nurture him, embrace him. In doing so, you keep me alive, you keep us connected.”

The truth settled within me, deep and unshakable. This journey was never about chasing something outside myself. It was about integration. About healing. About becoming whole.

The sun rose higher, gilding the sea with gold, and we stood together in silence, hand in hand. The waves carried on their eternal dance, rising, falling—moving ever forward yet always returning.

Leaving her was the hardest part. Every step away from the water, from her, felt like a loss. But I knew now—she was not gone.

She was within me.

She had always been within me.

As I re-entered the waking world, the warmth of her presence remained, not as a fading memory, but as a truth. A beacon.
