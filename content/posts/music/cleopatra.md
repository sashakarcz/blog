There are songs that don’t just speak to us—they speak from us.

“Cleopatra” by The Lumineers has echoed in the chambers of my heart for years, but recently, I heard it differently. Not just as a song of love lost, but of life passed by, and the quiet devastation of staying too long in places that no longer hold you.

This poem is my reply. A letter from the threshold.
A moment of truth where grief and liberation meet.

## Reply to Cleopatra

(A Letter from the Threshold)

Oh my dear Cleopatra—\
I see you there in black.

I lie in bed with others—wholly alone,\
Watching love just walk away,\
While I stayed in the dark.\
I slept my whole life through,\
Just to keep the shadows near,\
Those quiet, clinging ghosts,\
Whispering in my ear.

I prayed for you, you know.\
I prayed for dreams to bloom.\
But I was late for this, my love,\
Sealed in this silent room.\
Late to speak the words,\
Late to let the tears all fall,\
Late to finally see—\
Love wasn’t there at all.

You had your taxi’s hum.\
My vows became my chain.\
I was given a life to entomb,\
A marriage turned to stone,\
And a child who grew so tall,\
While I just stayed unknown.

You say you’ll die alone.\
You say you’ll be on time.\
But what if I could tell you now—\
I’m breaking from that line.\
I tear the binding script.\
No longer will I wait.\
I loved with all I had,\
And stayed until too late.

I bled into the silence,\
In rooms that held no grace.\
And now—I choose to breathe,\
To find my own damn space.\
Even if it means to walk,\
Right out into the light,\
With nothing but my soul,\
And the wilderness of night.

You can follow the script, my dear.\
But I—I’ll write my own.\
I’ll build a love from silence,\
A strength I’ve never known.\
I will become at last,\
The one I waited for.
